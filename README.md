# map_utils

Package for working with GeoJSON data.

```

Run the utility by building then using rosrun:

## Known Issues / Limitations

- Only supports creating polygons.
- Currently this is hardcoded to use `map` as a frame of reference.
- Placing the third point on a polygon doesn't draw a line for some unknown reason, might be an issue with Foxglove.
